							title="A Personal Website" alt="" /> I successfully coded my first personal website! Through this project, I gained a strong understanding of HTML and CSS, the building blocks of web development. I also learned the patience of troubleshooting and debugging code, which helped to improve my problem solving abilities. To ensure that every element worked as intended, I discovered the signficance of precision and detail that is required in coding. </a>

							alt="" /> For our client, my team and I helped design an improved wayfinding system for a historic building's complex layout. We integrated a wall-mounted floor map, interactive digital signs, and a QR-code-accessible map to enhance navigation. This solution aimed to simplify visitor access, reduce staff burden, and blend with the building's neo-Gothic style.</a>
