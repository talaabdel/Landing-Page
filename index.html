				<h2>WHAT I DO</h2>
			</header>
			<p>In September of 2023, I entered university as a general engineering major, completely unsure of my
				path
				and with no
				coding experience whatsoever. However, my first coding course, APS105 Computer Fundamentals, sparked a
				deep
				passion for technology that I
				hadn't anticipated... <br><br>After lots of relentless dedication and hard work, I not only developed my coding
				skills in C and python,
				but I was also able to secure a software engineering fellowship this summer at Headstarter AI! Over the next five weeks, my team and I will be developing five AI projects, culminating in a final project featuring an accepted PR from an open-source community.
				<br><br>Stay tuned for more exciting projects & contributions from meüí´üåé </p>

				<h2>MY WORK</h2>
				<p>As a future engineer, I strive to be a well-rounded individual passionate about collaboration and innovation. This summer, I was honored to be selected as a Headstarter AI Software Engineering Fellow. I am also currently working at Aziza as a Social Media and Communications Intern, where I craft and execute strategic content plans to engage and inform our target audience. Additionally, I am on my way to finishing up in-depth course that sharpened my skills in modern C++ programming, known as Udemy's "The C++20 Masterclass: From Fundamentals to Advanced". <br><br>As for next year, I am an incoming software engineer with the Blue Sky Solar UofT Design Team, excited to work on innovative projects focused on sustainable energy solutions. As a way to give back the engineering community, I serve as an Operations and Logistics Associate for UofT's largest student-run career network, organizing professional development events throughout the year to benefit all Uoft students.</p>
